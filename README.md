# Word2Vec - LLM Project

The following project is a Word2Vec implementation in Python, which is a technique for natural language processing (NLP) as well as a large language model (LLM). This project can be found in full detail in the report file of this repository. This report will detail a summary of the implementation of a Word2Vec model, the justification for its manner of implementation, as well as the answers to a series of important questions related to the model and its usage. This will be accompanied by plots and graphs to analyze results and showcase the performance of the model, as well as the analysis of a classification task utilizing a convolutional model.

## About this project
This project is the second homework assignment for the LLM class of the IASD Master 2023/2024, at PSL Research University (Université PSL).
It answers to the instructions given in the [hw2_word2vec_instructions.pdf](hw2_word2vec_instructions.pdf) file provided by the professors.
